Hi dear colleagues ! I updated the initial repository that we've created for the E-com TP. I've especially :
- Renamed the repository name ❌TP3_Application_Ecom❌ ==> ✅TP_JS_WebDevelopment✅
- Move all the initial folders and files related to the Ecom project in the folder `TP3_Ecom`
- Created a new folder `TP4_Jobs` and updated it with every important folder created in the Job project (in class, say the `src` folder). **RECOMMENDED**

  Please if you want to use the `TP4_Jobs`, make sure you install the JS framework `VueJS` on your computer.
